# practice-1
This is a project from the website, GeeksforGeeks. I modified and added many more components to the project for practice and improving the idea. the project is a number guessing game in which the user has three number range options. 1 to 100, 1 to 500, and 1 to 1000. the user then has has repectively 7, 8, and 9 chances to guess the number correctly. In order to improve the project and practice more components, I added more codes and graphical user interface.
