# practice-1
This is a project from the website, GeeksforGeeks. I modified and added many more components to the project for practice and improving the idea. the project is a number guessing game in which the user has three number range options. 1 to 100, 1 to 500, and 1 to 1000. the user then has has respectively 7, 8, and 9 chances to guess the number correctly. In order to improve the project and practice more components, I added more codes and graphical user interface.

Edit 1#: could not add the GUI to the project as it was to complicated of a task for me in my current level of proficiency. I managed to create a window, add a background image that can be resized with the window. I added the welcome message to the window however failed to add features such as scrollbar, interaction between the user and the program and displaying the messages of the program on the window. I am going to just finish the core code and not include the GUI.
